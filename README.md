- **View Projects**: The created projects are displayed as a list on the left side of the application. 
- **Project Details**: Clicking on a project displays the project details along with a form to create tasks for that project. 
- **Task Management**: Users can add tasks to the project, with tasks displayed in a list. 
- **Task Removal**: Users can clear tasks from the list.
- **Delete Project**: Users can delete a project from the project list.
- **Form Validation**: All forms in the app, including project and task creation, are validated to ensure proper data input.
